abstract = {Computational models are crucial in understanding brain function. Their architecture
is designed to replicate known brain structures, and the behavior that emerges is
then compared to observed fMRI and other imaging techniques. As the models become
more complex with more parameters, they can explain more of the observed phenomena,
and may eventually be used for diagnosis and design of treatments of brain disorders.
However, those parameters need to be carefully optimized for the models to work, which
becomes intractable as the models grow. In this preliminary work, CMA-ES has been
configured to optimize continuous parameters of a functional connectivity model, resulting
in a better fit to empirical data than manually selected parameters in all trial runs.
This approach will be combined with other EC techniques to optimize other parameters.
The techniques will be scaled up to more detailed structural and functional data and
local parameters.},
