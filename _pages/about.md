I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Toulouse. My research focused on dynamic architectural optimization for artificial neural networks. I was advised by <a href="https://d9w.github.io/">Dennis G. Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.ut-capitole.fr/accueil/m-herve-luga">Herv√© Luga</a>, as part of the <a href="https://sureli.isae-supaero.fr/">SuReLI</a> research group and <a href="https://www.irit.fr/departement/calcul-intensif-simulation-optimisation/reva/">REVA</a> team.
